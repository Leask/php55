php55
=====

Help you get out of '$ brew install php55' failure on Mavericks!


## Why?

Face it! You could not build PHP on Mavericks via homebrew smoothly now. But I can help you with this pre-build binary package.


## How?
* $ cd /usr/local/Cellar/
* $ rm -rf php55
* $ git clone git@github.com:Leask/php55.git
* $ brew link php55
* Enjoy it!


## Warning

This branch is for FPM only!
